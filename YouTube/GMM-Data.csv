Jupyter Notebooks have become very popular in the last few years, and for good reason. They allow you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and markdown text. This can all be run from directly in the browser. It is an essential tool to learn if you are getting started in Data Science, but will also have tons of benefits outside of that field. Let's get started.

Class methods are methods that automatically take the class as the first argument. Class methods can also be used as alternative constructors. Static methods do not take the instance or the class as the first argument. They behave just like normal functions, yet they should have some logical connection to our class.

159,Python Tutorial: Image Manipulation with Pillow,"In this video we will learn how to modify and manipulate images using the Python Pillow Library. Pillow is a fork of the Python Imaging Library (PIL). It will allow us to do many different things to our images such as: changing their file extension, resizing, cropping, changing colors, blurring, and much more.

Pillow is extremely useful when you have multiple images you wish to process at once. For example, you can use Pillow to automatically create different sized thumbnails of images you upload to your web server. Let's get started.

167,Setting up a Python Development Environment in Eclipse,"In this video, we will be setting up a Python development environment in Eclipse using the PyDev plugin. If you've watched my videos before, you have likely noticed I use the Sublime Text text editor for the tutorials. I use this for the videos because it is very clean and easy to use without all the bells and whistles of a full blown IDE. But there are times when an IDE is extremely useful. For example, if you need to debug your application, an IDE is likely what you would like to use.

There are several other options out there for Python IDEs. But Eclipse is free open source software. It can also be used to program in several other languages. Let's go ahead and get started on setting up our Python dev environment in Eclipse.

192,Git Tutorial: Change DiffMerge Font-Size on Mac OSX,"In a previous video, we learned how to use DiffMerge as a git difftool and git mergetool. As I was creating that video, I noticed a bug in the program that crashed DiffMerge when attempting to change the font-size. This bug has not yet been fixed by DiffMerge; however, there is a workaround.

All we need to do in open the preferences from the terminal and change the font-size manually.

210,CSS Tips and Tricks: Add External URLs to Print Stylesheets,"Printing out URLs can be a nice edition to print stylesheets. When someone prints your article or blog post, you want them to know where your links would have taken them so that they can investigate those sources further if they desire.

However, you don't want to include every link in the print stylesheet. Your internal links that loop back to your own website aren't necessary and will bog down the print stylesheet with a lot of unneeded text.

So how do we add only the external links to the print stylesheet? In this video, we will cover several techniques you can use in order to achieve this.

In this video, I'm going to show you a great way to add sample data to your WordPress site with Theme Unit Test and the Monster Widget plugin.

The Theme Unit Test data and Monster Widget plugin are two great ways to see how your theme visually handles a variety of content.

215,WordPress Plugins: Imsanity,"In this video, I'm going to show you my favorite WordPress Plugin for keeping large image sizes under control.

It seems like every modern camera and cellphone can take amazing pictures. But those large images can take up a lot of unneeded space on your server. Not to mention it will slow your pages to a crawl if you try to load multiple images that are thousands of pixels wide.

Imsanity fixes this problem by allowing us to set a maximum image size. Then every time an image is uploaded, the file is resized for us, saving us both time and space. We just set it and forget it. Simple as that.
