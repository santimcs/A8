in this video we are doing some Portfolio Optimization using Python and the pyportfolioopt library. I thought it would be interesting to apply modern portfolio theory concepts to cryptocurrency price data.
First we are pulling some historical price data using the Binance API, then we are calculating the Efficient Frontier and playing a bit around with Altcoins. In the end we are building an optimal portfolio using the maximum sharpe ratio and minimum volatility as the constraints.

In this video we are building a simple one layer Neural Network from scratch in Python. In specific we are setting up the input layer and initialize random weights and feed this data to the activation function (sigmoid).
The output is then compared with the actual output (y) and measured with the binary cross entropy loss.
If you found this interesting I will continue with optimizing the network using Gradient Descent and Parameter update using Backpropagation and provide details on how to proceed.

As said in the video you should not take this as a valid trading strategy. It is just an idea how a Logistic Regression could be used and how overfitting can be avoided or at least diminished using a train test split.

I am purposely NOT showing a time horizon where this is working or looking nicely to make you aware of that.

I am planning on covering other algorithms and extending the strategy. If you find that interesting please leave the video a like and subscribe :-)

In this one we are automating the process of getting buying signals based on technical indicators. In specific we are updating the MySQL database and sending ourselves mails containing those signals. In the end we are using cronjobs to automate the process. You need to define a proper time for the execution. I would guess midnight is a good way.

Alternative cron syntax for midnight would be: @daily

in this video we are going to scrape dividends to get an overview of when stocks are paying dividends in each month. This is getting the Ex-Dividend Date. In the US the payment date is usually roughly 1 month after the ex date so if you wanna have the payment date you would need to add up a month to that.

Feel free to use that on the S&P500 (working as well) or your home index. Let me know your thoughts in the comments below :-)

The momentum strategy is based on the findings of Jegadeesh/Titman and the conventional momentum strategy taking the past 12 month skipping the most recent month is just an application of Ken Frenchs approach.

The Value at risk is an important risk measure and is used in finance / banking , risk and Data Science related fields.

It starts with explaining how the Value at risk is calculated in Python, then applies this calculation to a two asset portfolio and then uses the covariance variance method to calculate the Value at risk again to make it scalable.

In the end I am pulling real stock prices to calculate the Value at Risk of a stock portfolio.

This video is not explaining the concept of the Value at risk in general and is just a technical implementation using Python. The method I am using is the so called
Variance-Covariance-Method.
